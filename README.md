It looks like a product management app with features like adding, updating, and deleting products, as well as form validation. Here's a quick overview of what My code does :

Key Features:

1- Adding Products:
  The (addProduct) function checks if inputs are valid before pushing a new product to arrProduct.
  
2- Updating Products: 
  The (semiUpdate) function loads the selected product data into the form, allowing it to be updated.
  
3- Deleting Products: 
  The (deleteProduct) function removes a product from arrProduct by its index.
  
4- Search: 
  The (display) function filters the product list based on the search input.
  
5- Form Validation: 
  The (validation) and (productValidate) functions handle form input validation, showing/hiding alerts as needed.
